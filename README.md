# 💬 Java AI ChatBot with Swing + OpenRouter API

A fully functional desktop **AI-powered chatbot** built with Java Swing and integrated with the **OpenRouter API** using the **Mistral-7B** large language model. This chatbot provides real-time responses, a clean GUI, and asynchronous message handling — offering a seamless user experience similar to ChatGPT, right on your desktop!

---

## 🖥️ Features

- 🖼️ Modern GUI built with Java Swing (`JFrame`, `JTextArea`, `JButton`, etc.)
- 🤖 Real-time responses from OpenRouter's Mistral-7B language model
- ⏳ "Thinking..." status while waiting for a response
- 📡 HTTP POST request handling with `HttpURLConnection`
- 🧵 Asynchronous API communication to keep the UI smooth
- 📑 JSON parsing using `org.json` library
- 🛠️ Easily extendable for new features

---

## 🚀 How It Works

1. User types a message and clicks **Send** (or presses Enter)
2. The app displays the user's message and a "Thinking..." placeholder
3. A background thread sends the message to the OpenRouter API
4. The response is parsed from JSON and displayed in the chat area

---

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Java 8+
- Swing GUI toolkit
- OpenRouter API (https://openrouter.ai)
- Mistral-7B Instruct model (`mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct`)
- org.json (https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.json/json)

---

## 📦 Setup Instructions

### ✅ Prerequisites

- Java SDK (8 or above)
- Internet connection
- OpenRouter API Key – [Get your key here](https://openrouter.ai/)

### 📥 Dependencies

Add the `org.json` library to your project:

**Using Maven:**

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.json</groupId>
    <artifactId>json</artifactId>
    <version>20240303</version>
</dependency>
````

**Or download JAR manually** from [Maven Central](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.json/json)

### 🔐 Replace API Key

Update the following line in your code with your **actual** API key:

```java
con.setRequestProperty("Authorization", "Bearer sk-...your_api_key...");
```
